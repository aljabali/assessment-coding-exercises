Assessment coding exercise
===============

### As software developer your code must be the poem you write every day .

Software development is a skill you never master, and in this assessment we need to discover more about you and your style of code ,and the most important we need to explore how much you can learn when needed.  

1. Check API documentation for COUNTRIES & CITIES API --> Filter 
URL: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1134062/T1LJjU52#c5cf3bfe-3c14-4167-ac6a-6f84c8b0d6b0
2. It is a JSON API that allows user to get specific data about countries.
3. The API got multi query parameters that can be passed in, for example
   > to get countries currency & dialcode you can pass in the following url
   https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries/info?returns=currency,dialcode
4. Create a very simple site that allow the user to :
    1. Select which fields would like to get its data, minimum checkboxes to show to user will be :
        1. currency
        2. dialcode
        3. flag
        * there are alot more try to add any
    2. On Submit , your simple site will get the data and display it in human-readable format "html bullets could be good idea"
    3. Feel free to do it in a language of your choosing.
    4. Provide your `ABOUT.md` and explain why you picked this language you did
5. Push your code to GitHub
6. Document the instructions for setting the site up in a local sandbox in your `README.md` file. withh all assumptions you've made about the API or the runtime environment. 
7. Document any known issues with your code.
8. Extra credit if your project hosted in heroku https://www.heroku.com/ 

Then share the links for the GitHub code and the site in Heroku "if you selected to deploy it and get the extra credit".
Here are the points we will review your assessment based on it :

* **Readability**: Coding style and naming convention 
* **Structure**: Object design and code architecture. Try not to over engineering your solution
* **Documentation**: Team work abilities , by providing clear enough documentation
* **Creativity** in choosing how to present the deals

**Notes:**
* Do not pay a lot of attention to your page layout , keep it simple and nice.
* It should take four to eight hours of effort for someone just graduated from related field, and maybe up to 12 hours if you new decided to deploy it to Heroku.
